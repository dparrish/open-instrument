A suite of tools for collecting, recording, aggregating and graphing any sort of timeseries data.

Includes:
  * A dynamic library for collecting stats from inside a running binary.
  * A timeseries storage server supporting very high throughput additions and using as much storage as you like.
  * A JavaScript graphing library to display recorded timeseries.
  * Tools to collect existing stats by SNMP and store them in the data store.
  * An RPC library to create your own tools to read and write to the data store.

**This is still in very early development, and not yet suitable for anybody who doesn't like code.**
